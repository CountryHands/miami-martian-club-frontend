Use the exchange to purchase your MATIC. We recommend buying an extra little bit of MATIC for the Gas Fees (still WAYYYY lower than ETH gas fees). You can see an estimation of these fees in our discord server where we have a MATIC gas tracker. Once you have purchased the appropriate amount of MATIC from the exchange, send it to your wallet. Now you are ready to mint your Martian. NOTE: we recommend purchasing and moving the matic into your metamask ahead of time as some exchanged require a short time period before funds can be moved."

Navigate to the tab labelled “Buy a martian” and connect your crypto wallet.I It is important to make sure your wallet is connected to the polygon network before minting. Navigate to the network section of your wallet and add the polygon chain if you have not already done so. The chain information can be found at https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/Input the required information found above.

We at the Miami Martian Club understand gas prices and have done our best to ensure you do not have to pay unreasonably high fees for gas. Ethereum Blockchain gas prices are high right now, so we decided to mint our collection on Polygon, an L2 branch of Ethereum with lower gas fees. Your Martian’s smart contract is still applicable across the Ethereum blockchain, but the gas fees cost you less. To get an estimation as to how much extra MATIC to purchase for the gas price, Head over to the Miami Martian Club discord server where you can see the gas prices in real time. Pssst… click the discord button to your left."

You may also need to import your Martian. Open Metamask on your mobile device (this is important) and navigate to the NFT tab and click ”import NFT”. The address information can be found on our Opensea page and the token ID would be on your martian’s opensea profile. Just click the opensea icon to your left.

To import them so that they are viewable on your mobile metamask wallet, navigate to “import NFT” within your metamask mobile app (make sure you are on the wallet account you minted from). Then input the contract address and token ID found in the details section of your NFT viewable in Opensea."
