		<h3 class="text-secondary text-xl font-black">Buying the correct amount of ETH.</h3>
		<p class="mt-5 px-7 text-md sm:text-lg font-['Inconsolata']">
			ETH is the currency used on the Ethereum blockchain network. You can purchase ETH using your
			Metamask wallet. Once in your wallet, press the “buy” button and use either Wyre or Transak to
			purchase your ETH. We recommend purchasing a little extra so that you have enough to cover gas
			fees.

		<h3 class="text-secondary text-xl font-black">What are gas fees?</h3>
		<p class="mt-5 px-7 text-md sm:text-lg font-['Inconsolata']">
			Just as it takes gas to power a car, it takes computing power to maintain the blockchain and
			deploy/execute the smart contracts that signify these images as non-fungible ERC-721 tokens.
			To see what the gas prices are now, check the Ethereum Gas Tracker on our server. Gas fees are
			displayed in the unit, Gwei.<br /><br />Gwei is a term for a very small amount of the Ethereum
			cryptocurrency and is commonly used when discussing transaction fees on the Ethereum network.
			One Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH. If a transaction cost is 0.000000020 ETH, you would say
			that the cost was 20 Gwei.

		<h3 class="text-secondary text-xl font-black">How to mint your Martian</h3>
		<p class="mt-5 px-7 text-md sm:text-lg font-['Inconsolata']">
			The process of purchasing your Martian and having it verified as an NFT on the blockchain is
			called minting. Once your wallet is connected, navigate to the Mint section of our website. It
			is important that your wallet is connected to the Ethereum Mainnet network before minting.

		<h3 class="text-secondary text-xl font-black">Where can I find my Martian?</h3>
		<p class="mt-5 px-7 text-md sm:text-lg font-['Inconsolata']">
			Once minted, your Martian will be transferred to your Metamask wallet. It may take a little
			time for the NFT to show up on Metamask, it can be found under the ”NFT” section on the app.
			We recommend that you also connect your wallet to <a
				href="https://opensea.io/"
				class="text-primary font-bold">OpenSea</a
			>.<br /><br />Your Martian will also be viewable on OpenSea in your “collected” section. You
			can use this to import the NFT to a MetaMask wallet. Navigate to “import NFT” within your
			MetaMask mobile app (make sure you are on the wallet account you minted from). Then input the
			contract address and token ID found in the details section of your NFT, viewable in OpenSea.
